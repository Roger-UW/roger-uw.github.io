# Rongxiao Fu

## Research Interests
Programming Languages, Type Systems, Functional Programming, Row Polymorphism

## Research Projects
- Typed ELEVATE (2019 ~ Now) - [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/elevate-lang/doc)
  - A strategy language which describes program transformations as compositions of rewrite rules.
  - Designed a row polymorphic type system with traces helping reject unproductive compositions of strategies, proved the soundness of the type system, and showed that unproductive strategies always evaluate to failures at run-time.
  - Implemented in Haskell.

- RISE (2019 ~ 2020) - GitHub Repo.
  - A functional language with dependent datatype for describing data-parallel computations.
  - Improved the type inference algorithm for RISE, avoiding repeated type inference during rewriting while ensuring the rewrite rules are type-preserving.
  - Implemented in Scala.
